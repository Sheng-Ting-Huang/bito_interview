  - time complexity O(log N) where N is the number of candidates in the matching system
- [Remove a Person](api/remove_person.md)
  - time complexity O(log N) where N is the number of candidates in the matching system
- [Query Possible N Matches](api/query_possible_n_match.md)
  - time complexity O(log N) where N is the number of candidates in the matching system

## System Design

- Defining a hash map as a candidate pool where the key is the person's identification generated by the system and the value is the personal information.
- Two slices for each gender served like a secondary indexes for swiftly lookup possible matches for the given person.
